  The last WOD I performed was the Invoice1 WOD (for more details, you can copy and paste this URL into your browser: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html). My first step for attempting the WOD was to do it once without any help. If I got stuck, I would refer back to my notes, or do a google search for solutions. Once I was able to figure out all of the steps, I wrote them all down so that I could remember them for my next attempt. 
  Before this WOD, I had taken notes from previous readings, so they were nice to refer to when I was attempting Invoice1 for the first time. With other WODs, I didn't handwrite my notes, and only depended on my memory (and I did not remember much). Handwriting notes helped me to memorize more of the information, and let me refer to them whenever I got stuck.
  To better prepare myself, I need to review my notes before attempting the WOD, rather than during. That would help reinforce my knowledge on the things we needed to know for the WOD, and I would be able to go through it faster. For this next WOD, I will definitely review my notes beforehand, rather than relying on them (and google) during the WOD.
