  Before I changed my major to MIS, I was majoring in computer engineering. I ended up changing my major to accounting because I started a website in the beginning of 2020, and I thought it was a good idea to learn how to keep track of finances and be my own accountant. However, I found out that accounting was not for me and I ultimately decided to major in MIS. I find that MIS is much more interesting than looking at numbers all day and the major pertains to what I do for work, so it was perfect! I'm hoping that taking this class will give me the skills I need to one day create my own ecommerce website from scratch.
