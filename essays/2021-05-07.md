**Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear.

**Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.**
The shopping cart will be a separate page. It will be really similar to the invoice.html, but will allow you to edit quantities and checkout once they have all the products in their cart. If the user is not already logged in, it will direct them to the login page. If they are already logged in, they will be directed to their invoice which is also emailed to them. 

**Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.**
Quantities of each product will be stored in each users session. This is an example of how sessions will be used to manage the shopping cart:
        var products_data;
        var total = 0;
        loadJSON('get_products_data', function (response) {
            // Parsing JSON string into object
            products_data = JSON.parse(response);
        });
        loadJSON('get_cart', function (response) {
            // Parsing JSON string into object
            shopping_cart = JSON.parse(response);
            for (pk in shopping_cart) {
                total += shopping_cart[pk].reduce((a, b) => a + b);
            }
        });

**How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?**
Only users who have successfully logged in or registered will be able to purchase anything from the shop. I need to add encryption to make sure that a user who does not have an account will be able to access personal information. 

**Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)**
When a user successfully logs in, they are greeted with their name. Once they check out, they are also told that an invoice has been sent to their email, and their email is displayed. I will be using cookies to store their username and email address.

**If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?**
I will not be working with a partner and will be doing all of the work myself.

**How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?**
With Assignment 3, I am going to start earlier and plan out everything I will need to do before I start. With assignment 2, I tried to put in the login/register page without thinking about how it was going to be executed. That made the process much more difficult and time-consuming. I will also leave more time to test my application and fix any problems I encounter, which I didn't do for Assignment 2.
